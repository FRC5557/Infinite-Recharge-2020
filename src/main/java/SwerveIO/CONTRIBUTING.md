SwerveIO is a highly specialized library designed to meet the programming standards
enforced by the style recommendations for the Java language. The [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
is a good guide to follow, however exact standards enforced in this library will be at the discretion of its maintainers.

Pull requests should be checked for quality, both in syntax and format, and in implementation. Suggestions should be offered in a friendly way.

----

To contribute to SwerveIO, follow the standard Github flow:

- Fork this repository to your own account
- Make your changes in your repository
- Submit a pull request

It is highly recommended to open an issue on a matter before writing a pull request, so that discussion can occur before an implementation is
formed. Should the issue be worthy of a pull request, it is acceptable for one or more members to collaborate on their own repositories to
formulate a pull request that can be submitted here.

Please follow all issue and pull request templates as well. We won't strictly enforce them, but it certainly makes it easier for the maintainers and contributors
of this project.

Our goal is to make the best product possible that can be used by the most people possible. Contributors should write code of their highest quality to ensure
the best possible library. "Best" as it is used here means:

- **Stable**: SwerveIO should be stable and work consistently no matter what.
- **Standardized**: All possible standards for the Java language should be followed.
- **Efficent**: Implementations should be clean and efficent, as determined by the maintainers of this project. Unnesessary solutions should be eliminated if possible.
- **Versatile**: SwerveIO, while being highly specialized, should have the most use cases as possible. This library was designed to be usable for all teams and all swerve drives.
